// Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2

// Given equation is y = 2x - 2
// Comparing this equation with y = mx + c

// Hence slope is
let m = 2;

// for x-intercept
let x = 0/2 - 2

// for y-intercept
let y = 2*0 - 2;

console.log("The slope is", m);
console.log("The x-intercept is", x);
console.log("The y-intercept is", y);
